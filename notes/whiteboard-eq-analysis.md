# Brainstorm Whiteboarding & Notes

Below we describe the API between semantic analysis and codegen of equations
_(with dependencies full features allowed in our LRM, ie: dependencies)_.

Note "SAST" below refers to Edwards' "semanticly-annotated"-AST _(ie: whatever
our semantic analysis outputs for codegen's use)_.

## Semantic Analysis

### SAST API Exposed to Codegen

## Codegen from SAST

### Questions

1. What does the ocaml look like for our SAST struct?
2. What have we not considered for `if`/`else`/`while` statemnets

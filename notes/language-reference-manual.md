# `EqualsEquals` Language Reference Manual (LRM)

## Compiler Phases

### Phase 1 of 5: Scanning with `lex`

#### What *Is* An `EqualsEquals` Program?
A valid program is a series of 1 or more `find` expressions. A `find` expression
is authored with a particular "context" (aka "scope") in mind, by default the
global scope. Other than the global scope, a context is a block of curly brace
enclosed code that defines explicit mathematical equations and functions _(or
multi-line equations)_.

An important feature of `EqualsEquals` is that context need not make equations
explicit _(that is, an equation can have multiple unknowns)_ until its
convenient, at the time a `find` block is written. An example of a `find` block
executed on the user-defined `Euclid` context _(where `gcd` is defined as a
multi-line function, or equation)_:
```c
Euclid = { /*... gcd defined here ...*/ }
Euclid:find gcd {
  a = 20; b = 10; print("%d\n", gcd);
}
```

#### Data Types & Syntax

Syntax includes:
1. Floating point numbers, including integers:
  ```ocaml
  let pos = ['1' - '9']                    in
  let dig = '0' | pos                      in
  let exp = ('e' | 'E') ('-' | '+')? pos+  in
  let fra = '.' dig+ exp?                  in
  let num = pos dig*                       in

  let flt = num | ((num | 0)? frac) | (num exp)
  ```
